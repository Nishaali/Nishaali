I am a bibliophile who loves to explore new domains and enrich my skillset. 

I am a final year Computer Engineering student looking for full time opportunities. I am proficient in C++, Java and Python languages. My database skills include Oracle SQL and MongoDB. I am also experienced in working with Spring Boot and REST services and proficient in HTML,CSS,PHP and Javascript. I have worked as a summer analyst in Citi.

Note: If not by my computer, you can find me reading a book or listening to music while sipping a cup of coffee.
